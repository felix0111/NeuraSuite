# NeuraSuite

This is a library for easily creating, optimizing and evaluating neural networks.

The "Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies" aka. NEAT algorithm by Ken Stanley is currently the only algorithm available.
It is planned to add other algorithms and types of neural networks in the future.

The DebugProgram.cs file contains an example on how to use this library.
