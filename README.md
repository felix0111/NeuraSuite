# EasyNNFramework

This is a framework for easily creating, changing and executing neural networks.

The "Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies" aka. NEAT algorithm is currently the only algorithm available.
It is planned to add other algorithms and types of neural networks in the future.

The DebugProgram.cs file contains an example on how to use this framework.
