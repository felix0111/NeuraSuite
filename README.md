# NeuraSuite

This is a library for easily creating, optimizing and running individual neural networks and also bigger populations.  
Features speciation, mutation, crossover, offspring evaluation for next generation and more.

The "Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies" aka. NEAT algorithm by Ken Stanley is currently the only algorithm available.
It is planned to add other algorithms and types of neural networks in the future.

The TestProject folder contains examples on how to use this library.
